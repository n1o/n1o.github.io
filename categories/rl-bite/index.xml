Known World Model Link to heading Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the simple case, and make an assumption that the underlying World Model of the Markov Decision Process is known, and we have finite discrete states. If we include that the Discount Factor $\gamma &amp;lt; 1$, we can find the Optimal Value function exactly using:</description></item><item><title>RL Bite: Bellmans Equations and Value Functions</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/rl-bite-bellmans-equations-and-value-functions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:00:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/rl-bite-bellmans-equations-and-value-functions/</guid><description>Value Based Reinforced Learning Link to heading In value based Reinforced Learning we learn a Value Function:
$$ V_{\pi}(s) = E_{\pi}[G_0|s_0 = s] = E_{\pi}[\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t|s_0 = s] $$
$G_t$ is the Total Return at time t, this is just the sum of Rewards an Agent gets walking the trajectory T (fancy name but this is just a sequence of actions the agent takes) $\gamma^t$ is the Discount Factor, long story short this is between $&amp;lt;0,1&amp;gt;$, the closer this value is to zero, the more the agent will focus on the immediate reward, the closer it is to 1 the more it will take future rewards into account.</description></item><item><title>RL Bite: Exploitation vs Exploration</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/rl-bite-exploration-vs-exploitation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 09:51:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/rl-bite-exploration-vs-exploitation/</guid><description>Explore vs Exploit Link to heading In reinforcement learning, we have an agent that has to take actions, for which it receives a reward. Here we have a dilemma: do we choose an action that gives the biggest reward or do we explore new actions that may lead to regions with even higher payouts?
Greedy Policy Link to heading This is a simple one, we always take the option that gives us the highest payout:</description></item></channel></rss>
