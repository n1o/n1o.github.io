# About

I'm Marek Barak, I started my journey into computer science when I was 15 by coding in C++, without having access to the internet and in good old fashioned [Bloodshed C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/). Since then nearly 20 years have passed, and I managed to get a Master degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Economics in Bratislava. I had the opportunity to do machine learning and build distributed systems for early to mid stage startups. Right now my day job is at [Paiqo](https://paiqo.com/) tackling anything Data related. At nights I am an independent Cyber Security Researcher figuring out how to apply Machine Learning to Cyber Security especially in the field of Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Exploitation.

My professional interests are: 
  
* Machine Learning
* High performance and distributed computing
* Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Exploitation
* Secure Coding

As for my personal life, I am married (Still finding it hard to figure out why she said yes!). I am also a father of three sons, cat person and a book worm committed to life long geek-hood.
