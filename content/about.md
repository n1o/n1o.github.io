# About

I'm Marek Barak, I started my journey into computer science when I was 15 by coding in C++, without having access to the internet and in good old fashioned [Bloodshed C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/) Since then more than 15 years has passed, and I managed to get an Master degree in computer science and statistics from the University of Economics in Bratislava. I had to opportunity to do build machine learning and distributed systems for early to mid sage startups. Currently my day job is at [Paiqo](https://paiqo.com/) tackling anything Data related. At nights I am an independent Cyber Security Researcher figuring out how to apply Machine Learning to Cyber Security especially in the field of Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Exploitation.

My professional interests are: 
  
* Machine Learning
* High performance and distributed computing
* Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Exploitation
* Secure Coding

As of my personal life, I am married (Still fiding it hard to figure out why she said yes!). I am also an father of three sons, cat person and a book worm committed to life long geek-hood.
