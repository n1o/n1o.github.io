# About

I'm Marek Barak, I started my journey into computer science when I was 15 by coding in C++, without having access to the internet and in good old fashioned [Bloodshed C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/). Since then nearly 20 years have passed, and I managed to get a Master degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Economics in Bratislava. I had the opportunity to do machine learning and build distributed systems for early to mid-stage startups. Right now, I am a Senior AI and Machine Learning Researcher at [ESET](https://www.eset.com), where I combine cutting-edge AI and cybersecurity. My passion lies in blending Machine Learning with vulnerability research, focusing on Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Exploitation.

My professional interests are: 
  
* Machine Learning
* High performance and distributed computing
* Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Exploitation
* Secure Coding

As for my personal life, I am married (Still finding it hard to figure out why she said yes!). I am also a father of three sons, cat person and a book worm committed to life long geek-hood.
