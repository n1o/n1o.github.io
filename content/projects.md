## [Study notes](https://n1o.github.io/study_notes/content.html)

This is my compilation of notes from various subjects. This is work in progress, where I continuously migrate, rewrite, simplify the notes I have. During the years I wrote thousands of pages worth of notes, not always concise. Right now I prefer taking notes that are somewhat similar to the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method. Thus keeping them short, easy to follow, covering at most a single subject. 

## [CodeBreakers](https://codebreakers.re)

This is a collection of posts and videos about reverse engineering, vulnerability exploitation and secure coding. Mainly focused on applying machine learning to these fields.
