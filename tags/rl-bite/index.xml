$$ V_{\pi}(s) = E_{\pi}[G_0|s_0 = s] = E_{\pi}[\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t|s_0 = s] $$
$G_t$ is the Total Return at time t, this is just the sum of Rewards an Agent gets walking the trajectory T (fancy name but this is just a sequence of actions the agent takes) $\gamma^t$ is the Discount Factor, long story short this is between $&amp;lt;0,1&amp;gt;$, the closer this value is to zero, the more the agent will focus on the immediate reward, the closer it is to 1 the more it will take future rewards into account.</description></item><item><title>RL Bite: Exploitation vs Exploration</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/rl-bite-exploration-vs-exploitation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 09:51:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/rl-bite-exploration-vs-exploitation/</guid><description>Explore vs Exploit Link to heading In reinforcement learning, we have an agent that has to take actions, for which it receives a reward. Here we have a dilemma: do we choose an action that gives the biggest reward or do we explore new actions that may lead to regions with even higher payouts?
Greedy Policy Link to heading This is a simple one, we always take the option that gives us the highest payout:</description></item></channel></rss>
