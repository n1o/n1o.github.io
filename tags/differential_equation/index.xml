These interventions may influence the dynamics of the timeseries. The question we want to answer is:
If I perform a hypothetical sequence of interventions how will my time series evolve?
An example and some details Link to heading Example Link to heading As a medical doctor in a hospital, if a patient has a high fever and is at risk of dying, a common practice is to measure their levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) to determine if they need antibiotics.</description></item></channel></rss>
