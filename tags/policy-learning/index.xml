In the next few posts, we are going to look into directly learning the policy. Why directly learn the policy? First, Q learning has a lot of issues involving the Deadly Triad; second, if we have continuous actions we cannot really use it; and lastly, Q learning always learns a deterministic policy, and in cases of partially observed stochastic environments (which is nearly always what we have), having a stochastic policy is proven to be better.</description></item></channel></rss>
