But when it comes to Language Models they lack some performance and that gave rise to SSM-Attention Hybrids. Until now it was conventional that in hybrid layers you sequentially combine Mamba(2) with Attention layers. Nvidia introduced Hymba - this paper changes the game by using Attention and Mamba2 in the same layer, each of them processing the same input tokens.</description></item><item><title>Distilling State Space Models from Transformers</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/distilling-ssm-from-transformers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 10:12:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/distilling-ssm-from-transformers/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading It is notoriously expensive to train a Language Model from scratch, making independent research impossible and trying out new architectures extremely risky. Because of these costs, Transformer++ models like LLaMa, based on Rotary Embedding, SwiGLU, MLP, RMSNorm, without linear bias, sometimes with grouped query attention and/or sliding window attention, are the de facto standard, not because they are the best, but because they are proven to work!</description></item><item><title>Mamba(2) and Transformer Hybrids: An Overview</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/ssm-transformer-hybrids-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 11:26:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/ssm-transformer-hybrids-guide/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading We have already looked into Mamba and Mamba2. In terms of efficiency, with their linear complexity and the absence of Key-Value cache, they are a significant improvement over Attention-based models in terms of throughput and memory usage. However, not everything is perfect. Transformers have a certain advantage when it comes to in-context learning. In-context learning is the ability to adapt the model without retraining it. This is done by providing relevant (or not) context to the model in the form of a prompt.</description></item><item><title>Hydra a Double Headed Mamba</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hydra-a-double-headed-mamba/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 11:53:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hydra-a-double-headed-mamba/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading State Space Models are awesome, models like Mamba and Mamba2 boast unparalleled performance especially when it comes to long sequences. The only downside is that they are causal, which means they model one token at a time, looking only at past tokens. Bidirectional models like Bert, CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT have been shown to excel when it comes to code understanding. One way to put it is that by looking into the past and the future simultaneously we can get a better understanding of what is happening.</description></item><item><title>From Mamba to Mamba-2</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/from-mamba-to-mamba2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 09:57:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/from-mamba-to-mamba2/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading This is not my first gig where I write about State Space Models. I already mentioned them here and here. Now what is the deal with this Mamba(2) thing? They are proving to be an alternative to the strong Transformer++ architecture (Transformer++ models like LLaMa are based on Rotary Embedding, SwiGLU, MLP, RMSNorm, without linear bias, sometimes with grouped query attention and/or sliding window attention). Hold on, if this Transformer++ models work well, why do we need altneratives?</description></item><item><title>Butterflies, Monarchs, Hyenas, and Lightning Fast BERT</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/butterflies-monarchs-hyenas-and-lightning-fast-bert/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 13:36:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/butterflies-monarchs-hyenas-and-lightning-fast-bert/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading I have been working on a project of creating my own Large Language Model, as I am huge fan of T5, or to be more concrete I recognize the added value of having an Encoder-Decoder architecture. The biggest challenge, at least in my opinion, in training an LLM is the sheer computational costs required to do so. I was originally planning to take the Encoder introduced by ColT5 but than I came across of M2 BERT and suddenly I went down the rabbit hole of Structured Matrices, Butterflies, Monarch and Hyeans.</description></item><item><title>BinT5 and HexT5 or T5 and Binary Reverse Engineering</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-and-reverse-engineering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 14:07:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-and-reverse-engineering/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading For a while now I have a new passion and that is binary reverse engineering and vulnerability exploitation. This interest has led me to create CodeBreakers a platform dedicated to applying machine learning to reverse engineering, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and other cybersecurity-related applications.
I found two notable research papers where T5 has been applied to reverse engineering are BinT5 and HexT5. Before we dive deep into the details of these papers, let&amp;rsquo;s first explore the basics of reverse engineering.</description></item><item><title>CodeT5 and CodeT5+</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/code-t5-plus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2024 08:46:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/code-t5-plus/</guid><description>Abstract Link to heading In a previous post, T5 the Old New Thing, we briefly touched upon CodeT5 and CodeT5+. Now, we aim to dive deeper into these topics.
I have previously explored CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. These models, based on BERT and RoBERTa architectures, excel at code understanding and retrieval tasks. However, they fall short when it comes to code generation tasks. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that these models share a common theme: they utilize unique pretraining objectives tailored specifically for source code.</description></item><item><title>Longer Context for T5</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/longer-context-for-t5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:10:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/longer-context-for-t5/</guid><description>Why does T5 need a longer context? Link to heading In my previous post T5 the Old New Thing we already explored why T5 is awesome. But one downside is its limited context length of 512 tokens. However, it does have a limitation - its context length is restricted to 512 tokens. This can&amp;rsquo;t be directly compared to the context length of a decoder-only model, as T5 is an encoder-decoder model.</description></item><item><title>T5 the Old New Thing</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 12:58:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/</guid><description>Why T5 Link to heading A couple of weeks ago I run into the following paper Tiny Titans. It compares multiple smallish (up to 1B parameters) open source LLMs with bigger proprietary ones on meeting summarization. TLDR; the small models tend to perform worse in zero-shot setting as well after fine-tunnig than big ones. Except for FLAN-T5-Large which after finetuning performs way beyond its league, beating even the biggest proprietary models (GPT-3.</description></item><item><title>Paper overview: Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hungry-hungry-hippos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 09:39:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hungry-hungry-hippos/</guid><description>High level overview Link to heading By combining State Space Models (SSMs) with Attention, we get a model that generates text more efficiently, with a speed increase of approximately 1.6 times. Additionally, this approach requires less paremters, enabling the development of larger models on existing hardware.
