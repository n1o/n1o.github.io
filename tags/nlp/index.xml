&lt;p>We have already looked into &lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/from-mamba-to-mamba2/" >Mamba and Mamba2&lt;/a>. In terms of efficiency, with their linear complexity and the absence of Key-Value cache, they are a significant improvement over Attention-based models in terms of throughput and memory usage. However, not everything is perfect. Transformers have a certain advantage when it comes to in-context learning. In-context learning is the ability to adapt the model without retraining it. This is done by providing relevant (or not) context to the model in the form of a prompt.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hydra a Double Headed Mamba</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hydra-a-double-headed-mamba/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 11:53:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hydra-a-double-headed-mamba/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="abstract">

&lt;p>State Space Models are awesome, models like Mamba and Mamba2 boast unparalleled performance especially when it comes to long sequences. The only downside is that they are causal, which means they model one token at a time, looking only at past tokens. Bidirectional models like &lt;a href="https://codebreakers.re/articles/detail/bert-codebert-and-graphcodebert/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bert, CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT&lt;/a> have been shown to excel when it comes to code understanding. One way to put it is that by looking into the past and the future simultaneously we can get a better understanding of what is happening. Hydra is a bidirectional extension of Mamba2 that builds upon solid mathematical foundations, instead of just naively taking two Mamba(2)&amp;rsquo;s, flipping one of them, and somehow combining them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Mamba to Mamba-2</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/from-mamba-to-mamba2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 09:57:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/from-mamba-to-mamba2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="abstract">

&lt;p>This is not my first gig where I write about State Space Models. I already mentioned them &lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/hungry-hungry-hippos/" >here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/butterflies-monarchs-hyenas-and-lightning-fast-bert/" >here&lt;/a>. Now what is the deal with this Mamba(2) thing? They are proving to be an alternative to the strong Transformer++ architecture (Transformer++ models like LLaMa are based on Rotary Embedding, SwiGLU, MLP, RMSNorm, without linear bias, sometimes with grouped query attention and/or sliding window attention). Hold on, if this Transformer++ models work well, why do we need altneratives? There are multiple reason:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Butterflies, Monarchs, Hyenas, and Lightning Fast BERT</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/butterflies-monarchs-hyenas-and-lightning-fast-bert/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 13:36:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/butterflies-monarchs-hyenas-and-lightning-fast-bert/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="abstract">

&lt;p>I have been working on a project of creating my own Large Language Model, as I am huge fan of T5, or to be more concrete I recognize the added value of having an Encoder-Decoder architecture. The biggest challenge, at least in my opinion, in training an LLM is the sheer computational costs required to do so. I was originally planning to take the Encoder introduced by &lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/longer-context-for-t5/" >ColT5&lt;/a> but than I came across of &lt;a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2024-05-20-m2-bert-retrieval" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M2 BERT&lt;/a> and suddenly I went down the rabbit hole of Structured Matrices, Butterflies, Monarch and Hyeans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BinT5 and HexT5 or T5 and Binary Reverse Engineering</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-and-reverse-engineering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 14:07:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-and-reverse-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="abstract">

&lt;p>For a while now I have a new passion and that is binary reverse engineering and vulnerability exploitation. This interest has led me to create &lt;a href="https://codebreakers.re" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeBreakers&lt;/a>
a platform dedicated to applying machine learning to reverse engineering, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and other cybersecurity-related applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found two notable research papers where &lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/" >T5&lt;/a> has been applied to reverse engineering are &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01701" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinT5&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/HexT5%3A-Unified-Pre-Training-for-Stripped-Binary-Xiong-Chen/04c3fccfe01f42afe18dcdb027385f350ab3c9d1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HexT5&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>In a previous post, &lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/" >T5 the Old New Thing&lt;/a>, we briefly touched upon CodeT5 and CodeT5+. Now, we aim to dive deeper into these topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have previously explored &lt;a href="https://codebreakers.re/articles/detail/bert-codebert-and-graphcodebert/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT&lt;/a>. These models, based on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BERT&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoBERTa&lt;/a> architectures, excel at code understanding and retrieval tasks. However, they fall short when it comes to code generation tasks. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that these models share a common theme: they utilize unique pretraining objectives tailored specifically for source code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longer Context for T5</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/longer-context-for-t5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:10:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/longer-context-for-t5/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-does-t5-need-a-longer-context">

&lt;p>In my previous post
&lt;a href="https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/" >T5 the Old New Thing&lt;/a>
we already explored why T5 is awesome. But one downside is its limited context length of 512 tokens.
However, it does have a limitation - its context length is restricted to 512 tokens. This can&amp;rsquo;t be directly compared to the context length of a decoder-only model, as T5 is an encoder-decoder model. This means that the encoder can process an input of up to 512 tokens, and the decoder can generate an output of up to 512 tokens, making the total context length 1024 tokens. In this article, we will discuss two extensions:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>T5 the Old New Thing</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 12:58:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/t5-the-old-new-thing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-t5">

&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago I run into the following paper &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00841" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Titans&lt;/a>. It compares multiple smallish (up to 1B parameters) open source LLMs with bigger proprietary ones on meeting summarization. TLDR; the small models tend to perform worse in zero-shot setting as well after fine-tunnig than big ones. Except for FLAN-T5-Large which after finetuning performs way beyond its league, beating even the biggest proprietary models (GPT-3.5).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paper overview: Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hungry-hungry-hippos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 09:39:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/hungry-hungry-hippos/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="high-level-overview">

&lt;p>By combining State Space Models (SSMs) with Attention, we get a model that generates text more efficiently, with a speed increase of approximately 1.6 times. Additionally, this approach requires less paremters, enabling the development of larger models on existing hardware.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Transformer architecture, which forms the basis of ChatGPT, is riding high on the hype train due to its impressive performance. Although it is just a basic &lt;a href="ttps://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/transformer.html" >Transformer&lt;/a>, it has proven to be extremely effective. The reason for its success is explored in the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In-Context Learning and Induction Heads&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; The authors argue that the majority of the in-context learning capacity of the Transformer architecture can be evaluated by two tests:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
