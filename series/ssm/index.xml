Because of these costs, Transformer++ models like LLaMa, based on Rotary Embedding, SwiGLU, MLP, RMSNorm, without linear bias, sometimes with grouped query attention and/or sliding window attention, are the de facto standard, not because they are the best, but because they are proven to work!</description></item></channel></rss>
