The idea is that our RL Agent not just learns a policy to follow or/and a value function (Q function) but also tries to model the environment it is in. This is done by learning the transition dynamics $p(s&amp;rsquo;|s,a)$ (also known as World Model) and a Reward function $\hat{R}(s,a)$. Once we have our world model, we can use it to simulate data and learn the model&amp;rsquo;s policy on the simulations.</description></item></channel></rss>
