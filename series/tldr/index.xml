Usually these techniques leverage Graph Auto Encoders, which are trained in a self-supervised fashion. This is all good; however, they usually focus on node feature reconstruction, and they tend to lose the topological information that the input Graph encodes.</description></item><item><title>TLDR; Duplex: Dual GAT for Complex Embeddings of Directed Graphs</title><link>https://n1o.github.io/posts/tldr-duplex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 09:22:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://n1o.github.io/posts/tldr-duplex/</guid><description>Source Link to heading Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05391 Github Implementation: https://github.com/alipay/DUPLEX Abstract Link to heading I am a huge fan of Graph Machine Learning, it has a lot of cool applications, and I am particularly interested in Source Code understanding and Vulnerability Detection, where Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are unambiguous. One of the obvious downsides of general GNNs is that they mostly focus on undirected graphs, which makes their approach somewhat limiting for Digraphs (fancy name for directed graphs).</description></item></channel></rss>
