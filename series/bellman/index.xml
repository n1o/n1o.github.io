$$ V_{\pi}(s) = E_{\pi}[G_0|s_0 = s] = E_{\pi}[\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t|s_0 = s] $$
$G_t$ is the Total Return at time t, this is just the sum of Rewards an Agent gets walking the trajectory T (fancy name but this is just a sequence of actions the agent takes) $\gamma^t$ is the Discount Factor, long story short this is between $&amp;lt;0,1&amp;gt;$, the closer this value is to zero, the more the agent will focus on the immediate reward, the closer it is to 1 the more it will take future rewards into account.</description></item></channel></rss>
